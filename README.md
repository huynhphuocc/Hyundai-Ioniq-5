## Project Overview
This repository contains the computational and simulation framework for the graduation thesis:  
**“Numerical Analysis and Simulation of Vehicle Crashworthiness alongside Occupant Protection Assessment on the Hyundai Ioniq 5.”**

## Key Objectives
- Implement a **MATLAB toolkit** for analyzing occupant safety.
- Develop **Simulink blocks** for occupant response estimation and dynamic crash pulse analysis.  

All calculations follow **ASI**, **Euro NCAP** and **NHTSA** safety assessment principles.


## Software Environment
| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|
| **MATLAB** | R2024a | Core numerical computation and plotting; main file: Initial_Calculation.m|
| **Simulink** | R2024a | Occupant dynamics and crash pulse modeling |
| **Visual Studio Code (Codespaces)** | Latest | Cloud-based collaborative editing and version control |

## Note: this version is on process, the completion will be available by December. Please do not take this as the reference.
