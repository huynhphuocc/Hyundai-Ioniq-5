## Project Overview
This repository contains the computational and simulation framework for the graduation thesis:  
**“Calculation, simulation of car crashing and evaluation of passengers’ safety on Hyundai Ioniq 5.”**

## Key Objectives
- Implement a **MATLAB toolkit** for analyzing occupant safety.
- Develop **Simulink blocks** for occupant response estimation and dynamic crash pulse analysis.  

All calculations follow **ASI**, **SAE J211** and **NHTSA** safety assessment principles.
